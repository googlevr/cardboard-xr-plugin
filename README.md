## Brand guidelines

The "Google Cardboard" name is a trademark owned by Google and is not included
within the assets licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Cardboard is a free
and open-source SDK that developers can use to create apps that are compatible
with the Google Cardboard VR platform. At the same time, it's important to make
sure that people don't use the "Google Cardboard" mark in ways that could
create confusion.

The guidelines below are designed to clarify the permitted uses of the "Google
Cardboard" mark.

**Things you can do**:

* Use the "Google Cardboard" mark to describe or refer to apps developed with
  the Cardboard SDK in ways that would be considered "fair use."
* Use the "Google Cardboard" mark to make truthful factual statements regarding
  the compatibility or interoperability of your app. For example, "This app is
  compatible with Google Cardboard" or "This app works with Google Cardboard."

**Things you can't do**:

* Don't use the "Google Cardboard" mark in a manner that implies that Google has
  endorsed or authorized your app or that makes your app appear to be an
  official Google product. For example, you shouldn't reference your product as
  "an official Google Cardboard app."
* Don't incorporate the "Google Cardboard" mark into your own product names,
  service names, trademarks, logos, or company names.
* Don't display the "Google Cardboard" mark in a manner that is misleading,
  unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene or otherwise
  objectionable to Google.
* Don't alter or distort the "Google Cardboard" mark. This includes modifying
  the mark through hyphenation, combination or abbreviation. For example, don't
  say "G Cardboard" or "Google-Cardboard."

In addition to these guidelines, please ensure that you follow the trademark
usage guidelines available here:
